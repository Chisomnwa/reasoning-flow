# reasoning-flow

## Overview

**Boosting reasoning with step-by-step logic**

Letting the model "think out loud" to show intermediate reasoning

## Learning Objectives
Apply chain-of-thought prompting to math, logic, and coding problems

Encourage reasoning before final answers with structured prompts

Create multi-step prompts for solving complex questions

**Note**: All submitted answers will be scanned using an AI Detector. If your response is identified as being generated by an AI tool (ChatGPT, etc.), it will be rejected. Make sure to write answers in your own words and avoid copying AI-generated text.

**Exercise 0:** Environment and Libraries

**Exercise 1**: Logic puzzle with explanation

**Exercise 2:** Step-by-step reasoning prompt

**Exercise 3**: Multi-step question answering

## Virtual Environment
OpenAI Playground or ChatGPT interface

Python 3.9+ installed locally (for code-related tasks)

---

## Exercise 0: Environment and Libraries
**Objective:** Set up the environment for Python development.

Install Python (latest stable version, preferably 3.9+).

Verify installation by running:

python --version
Write and execute a Hello, World! program.

---

## Exercise 1: Logic Puzzle with Explanation
Objective: Guide the model to solve a problem with explicit reasoning.

Write a logic puzzle (e.g., "Alice is older than Bob, Bob is older than Carol. Who is the youngest?").

Prompt the model: "Explain your reasoning before giving the final answer."

Verify that the model provides step-by-step reasoning followed by the correct answer.

---

## Exercise 2: Step-by-Step Reasoning Prompt
Objective: Use structured prompting to encourage reasoning.

Choose a math or coding problem (e.g., "Calculate the factorial of 5").

Prompt the model: "Let's think step by step before answering."

Compare outputs with and without the reasoning instruction.

---

## Exercise 3: Multi-Step Question Answering
Objective: Break complex questions into smaller steps.

Select a multi-step question (e.g., "What is 25% of the sum of 40 and 60?").

Create a prompt that asks the model to:

Restate the problem

Break it into smaller steps

Solve each step before giving the final answer

Review the reasoning process and check the accuracy of the final solution.

## Submission
Provide all exercises. For each exercise include the prompts, model outputs, and a brief sentence analysis highlighting the reasoning process, step-by-step logic, and how intermediate steps contribute to the final answer. Ensure differences between prompts with and without chain-of-thought instructions are clearly documented.
