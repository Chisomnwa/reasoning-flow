# Exercise 1: Logic Puzzle with Explanation

**Objective:** Guide the model to solve a problem with explicit reasoning.

Write a logic puzzle (e.g., "Alice is older than Bob, Bob is older than Carol. Who is the youngest?").

**Prompt the model:** "Explain your reasoning before giving the final answer."

Verify that the model provides step-by-step reasoning followed by the correct answer.

---

Yes, the model provided a step-by-step reasoning followed by the correct answer.

---

**Here is its response:**

Let’s break it down step by step.

Alice is older than Bob
→ Alice > Bob (in age)

Bob is older than Carol
→ Bob > Carol

If Alice is older than Bob, and Bob is older than Carol, then the age order from oldest to youngest is:

Alice → Bob → Carol

So the person with the smallest age (the youngest) is Carol.

✅ Final Answer:

Carol is the youngest.
